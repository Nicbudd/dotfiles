# DOTFILES

These are my dotfiles. Use them if you wish.

There is a bash program called .shortcuts which lists out my i3 shortcuts in a nice colored out manner. Use it and update it as much as you want.

There is also an atom syntax-theme package for this style too.

## Setup

I am running i3/XFCE/Debian on my laptop and AwesomeWM(hopefully i3 soon)/Kubuntu on my computer.

## Neofetch
