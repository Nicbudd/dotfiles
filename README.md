# DOTFILES

These are my dotfiles. Use them if you wish.

There is a bash program called .shortcuts which lists out my i3 shortcuts in a nice colored out manner. Use it and update it as much as you want.

There is also an atom syntax-theme package for this style too. It can be downloaded from here. https://github.com/Nicbudd/nicbudd-syntax

## Notes

If you would like to get current weather conditions in i3status, you must change
the station and network in scripts/currentconditions.py, and create and give
write permissions to the file /var/currentconditions.log

## Setup

I am running i3 / XFCE / Debian on my laptop and AwesomeWM (hopefully i3 soon) / Kubuntu on my computer.
